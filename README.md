How to Run the Scripts
To run the scripts, follow these steps:

Install Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can check if it's installed by running node -v in your command line.

Navigate to the Project Directory: Open your command line or terminal and navigate to the folder where the scripts are located. For example:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project/src
Install Dependencies: If you havenâ€™t already, install the required dependencies by running:

Copy code
npm install
Run the Scripts: Execute each script using Node.js. You can run them individually like this:

Copy code
node simplified_proof_of_work.js
node dynamic_difficulty.js
node calculate_hashpower.js
1. simplified_proof_of_work.js
Purpose:
This script illustrates a simple proof-of-work algorithm.

Functionality:
It tries to find a valid nonce by hashing a mix of data and the nonce.
A valid hash must have a specific number of leading zeroes, which depends on the difficulty level.
The script runs with two different difficulty levels to demonstrate how difficulty impacts the ability to find a block.
Example Output:
yaml
Copy code

Block found! Nonce: 286, Hash: 00328ce57bbc14b33bd6695bc8eb32cdf2fb5f3a7d89ec14a42825e15d39df60

Running simplified proof of work with difficulty 4...
No block found within max attempts.
2. dynamic_difficulty.js
Purpose:
This script simulates a proof-of-work system that changes mining difficulty based on how fast blocks are found.

Functionality:
It mines blocks and tracks how quickly they are discovered.
If blocks are found more quickly than expected, the difficulty level increases.
If blocks are found more slowly, the difficulty decreases.
The script outputs the nonce and hash of each block found along with the current difficulty.
Example Output:
yaml
Copy code
Block found! Nonce: 24, Hash: 0eb425ad35184a83ee4ab20ef62be62686e78d29e68fd9c7fb486b87e7b0d3c2

3. calculate_hashpower.js
Purpose:
This script estimates the hash power of your computer.

Functionality:
It measures how many hashes your computer can perform in a specific time frame.
This information is used to estimate how long it would take to find a block in the current Bitcoin network based on your computer's hash power.
Example Output:
yaml
Copy code
Hash power: 3500 hashes/sec
Estimated time to find a block: 172800 seconds (approximately 48 hours)
